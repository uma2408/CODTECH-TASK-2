#**Overview of the Hospital Management System Program:**

This Java program is a console-based application designed to manage various aspects of a hospital or healthcare facility. It is modular, menu-driven, and uses object-oriented principles to organize data and functionality into distinct classes and methods.

##**Key Features:**

**Patient Registration:** Stores patient details such as ID, name, contact information, and condition.
Uses the Patient class to encapsulate patient-related data.

**Appointment Scheduling:** Manages appointment details, including patient ID, doctor name, date, and time.
Uses the Appointment class to organize appointment data.

**Electronic Health Records (EHR):** Allows viewing of all registered patients and their information.

**Billing and Invoicing:** Not explicitly implemented but could be integrated into this framework as an additional module.

**Inventory Management:** Tracks medical supplies by name and quantity.
Supports adding new items and viewing the current inventory.
Uses the Inventory class to represent each inventory item.

**Staff Management:** Allows for adding and viewing staff members' details, such as ID, name, and role.
Uses the Staff class for staff-related data.

**User-Friendly Menu:** Offers a simple interface for navigating through different functionalities.
Allows users to perform tasks interactively in a step-by-step manner.

##**Program Structure:**

**Classes:**

**Patient:** Represents a patient with properties like ID, name, contact, and condition.

**Appointment:** Represents an appointment with details like appointment ID, patient ID, doctor, date, and time.

**Inventory:** Represents inventory items with name and quantity.

**Staff:** Represents hospital staff with ID, name, and role.

**Data Storage:** All records (patients, appointments, inventory, and staff) are stored in List objects (e.g., ArrayList), providing flexibility to add and retrieve records dynamically.

**Menu-Driven Workflow:** A while loop continuously displays a menu for user interaction.
Users can select options to perform actions like registering a patient, scheduling an appointment, managing inventory, or viewing staff.

**Input/Output:** Uses the Scanner class for reading user input.
Displays feedback and information to the user via System.out.println.

###**How It Works:**

**Initialization:** The program begins by displaying a menu with different options.

**User Interaction:** Users select an option and provide the necessary details.
Data is stored in the respective List objects.

**Data Retrieval:** Users can view stored data like patient lists, appointments, inventory items, or staff details.

**Termination:** The program continues until the user chooses the exit option (option 7).

####**Example Use Cases:**

**Registering a Patient:**

Input: P001, John Doe, 1234567890, Flu

Stored in the patients list.

**Scheduling an Appointment:**

Input: A001, P001, Dr. Smith, 2024-12-22, 10:30

Stored in the appointments list.

**Managing Inventory:**

Input: Bandages, 50

Stored in the inventoryItems list.

**Adding Staff:**

Input: S001, Alice Johnson, Nurse

Stored in the staffMembers list.

Potential Enhancements

**Data Persistence:** Use a database (e.g., MySQL) or file storage to persist data across sessions.

**Error Handling:** Add validation to ensure valid inputs (e.g., valid dates, non-empty strings).

**User Interface:** Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX or Swing.

**Billing Module:** Include functionality to calculate bills for treatments and generate invoices.

**Search and Edit Functionality:** Allow searching, updating, or deleting records.

This program provides a solid foundation for a hospital management system and can be extended to include more advanced features as needed.
